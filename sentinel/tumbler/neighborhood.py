"""neighborhood.py — the local twin neighborhood the sentinel lives in.

Three watchers are supposed to keep this estate honest: **openrappter**, the
**brainstem**, and **copilot**. The failure this whole ecosystem keeps getting
bitten by is a watcher that dies quietly while everything downstream keeps
reporting green off data that stopped moving. A watchdog nobody watches is
just another process that can stall in silence.

So the three are modelled as what they actually are under
`rapp-neighborhood-protocol/1.0`: **uniform peers** (§3) in a **kited
neighborhood**, each a **Neighbor** with its own **rappid**, speaking the one
**twin-chat** envelope (§6, `rapp-twin-chat/1.0`) over a local file relay.

And crucially, each neighbor's heartbeat is a **rapp/1 frame** (§7): an
11-key, content-addressed, hash-chained record. That is the whole point of
using the protocol here rather than writing more JSON — a chain cannot be
quietly rewritten to look healthier than it was. `roll_call()` re-verifies
every chain from genesis on every tick, so a stalled *or* tampered watcher is
detectable by the other two.

CONFORMANCE — stated honestly, per §16:
  ✅ speaks the §6 twin-chat envelope
  ✅ supports a §5 transport (local file relay — §18 names local file as a
     valid relay form; this neighborhood is on-device by design)
  ✅ uses the §1 vocabulary (Neighbor, twin-chat, kited neighborhood)
  ⛔ does NOT implement the §8 sealed codec (`rapp-sealed/1.0`), therefore
     this does NOT claim full §16 conformance. It rejects `console` kind
     outright rather than pretending to seal it. Everything stays on-device
     and never crosses a network, which is why that is an acceptable trade
     here — but it is a gap, and it is written down rather than glossed.

Frames follow `rapp/1` exactly, via the vendored reference implementation
(rapp.py, copied from kody-w/rapp-1 — stdlib only).
